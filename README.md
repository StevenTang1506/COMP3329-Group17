# Game description:
•	The little penguin got lost with his parent in the South Pole due to melting ice. In a world filled with ice and freezing water, your task is to help the little penguin to get back with his parents!
•	You need to bring the penguin to go through 3 levels in order to accomplish the task and you will face some obstacles on your way there.
•	Collect as many coins as you can in the first 2 levels and other than coins, there will be tools (an axe) on the way. You will need that to get to the finishing point ^^
•	Good luck on the adventure and help the penguin!! 

# Games rules:
•	The player will be controlling the little penguin.
•	For obstacles, the player may jump (space bar) and go around them. 
•	To control the movement of the penguin, use key A to go left and key D to go right. 
•	To interact with the objects, use key E when there is a ‘!’ sign.
•	You will die if you get crashed by the rocks or fall from the ground. If you see the dizzy stars appeared on the head of the penguin, that means you need to start all over in that level 
